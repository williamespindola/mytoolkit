## Contributing

To include a new tool or topic you should fork and send a Pull Request to 
tools.json file. Something like this:

**new tool**

```json

    "name": "name of tool here",
    "link": "link to tool site project",
    "description": "short description",
    "meta": ["meta 1", "meta 2"]
}
```

## History

I needed a location to storege and that can be easy to find which tool do I use
in my project or other. So I thought this might be public for anyone store and 
find.
